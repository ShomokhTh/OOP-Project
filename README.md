# OOP-Project

###
The main idea is to have a system that shows the user who lost something if there's another user who found the same 
thing the first user lost and looking for.
The tasks the system offers:
1. search in the "found properties" for the thing that  the user lost, and if it does not exist in the found properties the user can add it to the "lost properties". and the user who found a lost item can add it to 
the "found properties". 
2. gave the user the option to set an appointment with the user who found his missing property. 
3. gave the user the option to print all the properties and their status (lost or found).
